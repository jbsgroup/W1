    <p>Hi my name is Mitchell. I'm from New Hampshire. I literally googled stock photos and grabbed a random one first of all to explain the image. So uh I'm just gonna really stretch this out becuse I can barely even write two sentences about myself. I'm a certified Gamer Boy. I love both board and video games. My favorite board game is Betrayal at House on the Hill, which can be played with 3-6 people and is very randomized, and is super fun. Favorite video games are TF2 and The Binding of Isaac.</p>
    <p>I also like to watch anime and read manga in my free time. Favorite serieses are City Hunter, One Punch Man, Mission: Yozakura Family, and Mashle: Magic and Muscles (in no particular order).</p>
